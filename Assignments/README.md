# About Assignments

Assignments are provided in the class repository and will include instructions to create a new project in your own account from scratch or by forking another and adding history to the project. Every assignment will involve [opening a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) (called a PR) and potentially [opening an Issue](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issues) to refer to the PR if it's not for this repository. Issues and Pull Requests allow us to have a conversation about your assignment within the context of the code or text that you're writing and with code-friendly formatting options. Please review [the simple formatting syntax for Issues and PRs, Github Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown).
