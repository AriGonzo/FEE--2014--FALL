# Class Notes

The format of the class is very interactive and experiential. Every class will involve a set of notes and scratch files for experimenting with code. This is where we'll recap the Big Ideas from each day, week, and module. This is collaborative, so while I start the notes off, each student can add to the notes through Pull Requests and Issues. I encourage everyone to correct my typos and suggest additional ideas and examples.
